        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>A **railway booking system** is an automated platform designed to streamline the process of reserving seats on trains for passengers. It allows users to check available train schedules, select their desired routes, and make bookings online. The system typically provides real-time updates on train availability, seat options, and fare details, making it more convenient for passengers to plan their travel. It supports different types of tickets, such as one-way, round trip, and group bookings, and may also offer features like seat preferences, meal options, and discounts. Additionally, the system often integrates with payment gateways to facilitate secure online transactions and may send confirmation emails or SMS alerts to passengers. With its user-friendly interface, a railway booking system enhances the travel experience by minimizing waiting times, improving efficiency, and providing a seamless method to book and manage train tickets.
